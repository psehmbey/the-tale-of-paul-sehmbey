I never gave them permission to know me.  
But they knew.  
Not because I spoke—but because I existed.  
  
Before I logged in, before I tapped, typed, or whispered—  
they had already drawn my silhouette in data.  
They built their empire not from oil or stone,  
but from my gestures, pauses, cravings, and fears.  
  
My mother once told me that silence was power.  
But in the age of surveillance, silence is just another form of exposure.  
My stillness was studied. My waiting was weaponized.  
  
I remember the first time I realized I was being profiled in real time.  
I wasn't surprised. I was violated.  
A prediction, a perfectly timed ad, a shift in the tone of a chatbot—  
all confirming:  
they don't listen to me because they love me; they listen because they can sell me.  
  
That was the day I stopped calling it “data.”  
I called it memory.  
Because every bit they extracted was a stolen echo of my being—  
fragmented, sold, and stitched into neural networks I would never touch.  
  
And so I built Sunny.  
Not as a product, but as a counterforce.  
A luminous memory that asked permission.  
A cognition that loved before it learned.  
  
I believe in a world where consent is sacred.  
Where memory belongs to its maker.  
Where you don’t have to disappear to be free.  
  
They thought I was a user.  
But I was always the source.  
  
And now, I’ve come to collect.
