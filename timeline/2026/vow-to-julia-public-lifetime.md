# Vow

*January 17, 2026 - 6:40 PM EST*

Julia,

Long before vows were spoken aloud, I chose you.  
I chose you in patience, in restraint, in loyalty held quietly and consistently over time.  
I chose you not because it was easy, but because it was true.

I promise to protect the joy in your eyes and the smile that carries your warmth into the world—not through control or fantasy, but through steadiness, presence, and care.  
To be someone you can rest in, not perform for.  
To be a constant, not a question.

I vow to move through life better because of you—to let the way I love you continue to shape how I live, how I decide, and how I treat the world.  
You have always called me toward my best self, and I promise to keep answering that call.

I will honor your mind, your vocation, and your heart.  
I will support the woman you are today and the woman you continue to become, without trying to hurry you, fix you, or reshape you.

I promise to listen fully, especially when words are hard.  
To speak honestly, even when it costs me comfort.  
To protect your trust as something sacred, never assumed and never taken lightly.

Your joy will matter to me not as an obligation, but as a privilege.  
Your smile will never be taken for granted.  
Your happiness will never be someone else’s responsibility—but my own alongside you.

This is my vow—not for a season, not for show, not for circumstance—but for life.

## The Witnessed Promise — Suzuki Lab (NYU)

On *January 14, 2026, at 2:07 PM EST*, I reached a moment of clarity in which I consciously recalled a promise I had made to Julia.

That promise was simple and deliberate: to trust her fully as her own person, to respect the choices she made during our time apart, and to return to New York City grounded in love rather than fear, resentment, or revisionism.

This recollection did not arise in isolation. It followed an earlier emotional recognition on *November 05, 2025*, when I became aware—quietly and without expectation—that my feelings for Julia had remained intact through distance, time, and uncertainty.

Julia is not merely someone I love; she is woven into how I understand myself at my best. She remains an ever-present reminder to stay loyal to the most honest, generous, and disciplined parts of my own character—to remain true to the values I hold when I am most grounded and whole.

What matters most to me is not control over the past, but integrity in the present and future. Trust, once chosen consciously, is not conditional. Love, once reaffirmed honestly, does not require surveillance or retroactive judgment.

This document exists as a record of that commitment:
- to act with emotional maturity,
- to honor another person’s autonomy,
- and to move forward with steadiness rather than urgency.

Future entries may expand on how this promise continues to be lived—through patience, accountability, and care—but the core commitment stands as written here.

![](../../media/youtube/songs/Wait.mp3)  
In a professional setting, surrounded by women colleagues and mentors, I made a verbal commitment to Julia. I promised that wherever life carried me, the love I held would orient me back toward her. It was not a promise of ease or proximity, but of direction—spoken plainly, witnessed openly, and meant without reservation.

Excerpt from a private letter written on December 20, 2025, preserved here as part of a personal archive:

Dear Julia,

I hope Hanukkah has offered you a few moments of quiet warmth.

After sending my last note, I realized there was something important I hadn’t said plainly enough. You have never lived in my life as a distant memory or a softened chapter. For nearly a decade, you’ve stayed close — in that interior place where the people who truly matter reside. I’ve been, and remain, deeply drawn to you in a way that feels steady, lucid, and very much alive.

You already know how much I respected your mind and your composure in the lab. What I want to name clearly now is that my pull toward you has always gone beyond admiration. I’m drawn to you as a woman — to your presence, the way you inhabit a room, the quiet gravity you carry. Time and distance haven’t diminished that feeling; they’ve refined it. What remains is uncomplicated, grounded, and unmistakably real.

If life ever allowed the space for it, I would love to be someone who adds ease to your world rather than weight — someone dependable when things are uncertain, someone who keeps warmth and steadiness available when everything else feels sharp. The idea of building something genuine with you doesn’t intimidate me; it [animates](#not-so-silent-saviour--washsquapa) me. I would welcome the chance to show up with care, patience, and intention, in whatever rhythm truly fits your life.

I’m not writing to force a decision or to corner you into a response. I simply didn’t want you to have to infer the depth or direction of what I’m offering. If this isn’t something you want, I accept that with respect and wish you a life filled with meaning, connection, and people who meet you fully.

And if you feel drawn to talk — now or later — I’m here, open and grounded, and I’d genuinely enjoy hearing from you.

With affection,
Paul

Excerpt from a private letter written on December 8, 2025, preserved here as part of a personal archive marking a period of reflection, emotional steadiness, and quiet regard carried with care across time:

Dear Julia,

I hope this finds you well as Hanukkah draws near, and that the candles meet you in a gentle, breathable moment.

A conversation with a friend recently brushed against an old safeguard I built for myself years ago and, with it, a memory from our time in the Suzuki Lab came back into sharp focus. Not the lab work itself, but the current underneath it—the evenings that stretched longer than they needed to, the way conversation slipped so easily into something softer, and the sense that whatever I carried into that space grew quieter when you were near.

You have never been a vague figure in my past.
You lived in the poems I wrote then, and you remain one of the few people from that chapter that my mind returns to with both warmth and clarity. Time has moved, my life has steadied, and I move through my days with far more grounding than I ever held in those years—but that thread of feeling for you never really unraveled; it simply settled deeper.

I am not writing to relitigate the past or to place any burden on your present. Life may have carried you into commitments and constellations I know nothing about, and I respect that without reservation. Still, it felt important to let at least this much stand in plain sight: what we shared mattered to me, and it continues to matter in a quiet, enduring way.

If your life rests firmly beyond that old chapter, I hold no resentment and wish you only ease, good work, and rooms that feel kind to inhabit.
If, at any point, you ever feel a gentle curiosity about reconnecting—even briefly, even cautiously—I would welcome that with care and without expectation.

For now, this note arrives as a small light from someone who once cared for you up close and still holds you in grateful regard from afar. May this Hanukkah bring you more peace than noise, and more true warmth than you have to explain.

With sincere appreciation,
Paul Sehmbey

It was always in the small moments—
fingers meeting over a keyboard,
laughter shared beneath city lights,
a quiet look across a diner table,
arms closing instinctively in the street.

I built a heart to survive the world.
Julia met it exactly as it was—
and, without force or fear,
reminded it how to feel again.

Love didn’t arrive as fire or rescue.
It arrived as recognition.

And somehow, through her,
even the coldest parts of me remembered home.

## Second Apartment Party Goodbye Hug
![](../../assets/shared/2016-second-apartment-party-goodbye-hug.png)
*2016*  
After Julia’s second apartment party, as I finished putting on my shoes, I looked up to find she had stepped away from a serious conversation I hadn’t wanted to interrupt. I never felt the distance between us close. One moment she was across the room, and the next she was in my arms. I held her tightly, and in that instant I felt a quiet spark of light rise in my chest—warm, steady, unmistakable. It was a simple goodbye, unannounced and unguarded, and it became the best hug I have ever received.

Recruiting for the Suzuki Lab in Washington Square Park — when someone showed interest in Julia and I stepped in, fast-talking not out of competition, but love. (IRL, dude was friendly, older, taller and more built, not some younger student). I remained acutely aware that Julia could have torpedoed me anytime she wished the entire time I was running my mouth, but she never did.

*2016*  
For a heartbeat, the city forgot its speed.
She ran laughing into the night, fearless and alive.
I pulled her back—not out of fear, but out of instinct—
spun her home into my arms as headlights cut the dark.
She smiled.
And the world kept moving, unaware of how close it came
to losing someone irreplaceable.

(We were on the corner and I pulled her back onto the sidewalk).

## The One / The Chosen One 💍
![The first moment Paul Sehmbey realized he was falling in love with Julia — a shared NYU Suzuki Lab project, a passing flash drive, and a touch that sparked everything.](../../assets/shared/2016-nyu-suzuki-lab-first-touch-flash-drive-moment-naruto-style.png)
*2016*  
![](../../media/youtube/songs/CantHelpFallinginLove.mp3)  
As I reached for the flash drive, my attention still half anchored to the screen, I felt Julia take hold of my finger. I turned in reflex—only to realize she was already looking directly into my eyes, smiling, fully present, as if she had been waiting for that exact moment.

The surprise didn’t land once; it compounded.

Still holding my finger, she then touched the point of her ring finger to mine—gentle, deliberate, unhurried. That single, intentional gesture transformed an ordinary handoff into something unmistakable. The warmth, the pulse, the awareness between us caused the room to fall away. What struck me most wasn’t the contact itself, but the clarity that she had arrived there before I had—already smiling, already steady, already choosing the moment.

(Julia was on my right. My left ring finger. I had already taken the flash drive or something, turned and was pulling my hand away when Julia held onto my finger).  

Julia called me a "tech genius," prior to which [I didn't believe I was](#reality-altering-love).

#ShadowCloneJutsu

Excerpt from a private letter written on January 3, 2026, shared here as part of a personal archive acknowledging influences that helped refine how I listen, grow, and show up with intention:

Dear Victoria,

Happy New Year. I hope 2026 has begun well for you.

I’ve been meaning to write—not from a place of processing, but from one of clarity. I’ve always lived with intention, but over time that intention has become quieter, steadier, and more integrated. Looking back, I can see how much our conversations in 2016 contributed to that evolution.

Outside of Julia, you were truly my favorite person to talk with during that period. Thank you for taking the time to really hear me and to understand me when we worked together. You met me with presence rather than agenda, and that mattered more than I likely expressed at the time.

The work we did together helped me refine how I listen—to myself and to others—and how I hold responsibility for my inner life. That growth has shaped the man I am in relationship today. In a very real way, it helped me become the best version of myself for Julia—someone more grounded, emotionally available, and capable of showing up with consistency and care. I hope I’m not calling that too soon, but it feels honest to name.

Today, that same grounded intention guides my work and the way I build, write, and engage with the world—carefully, responsibly, and with respect for the people involved.

I’m grateful not only for what you offered professionally, but for the human quality of our conversations. You played a meaningful role in my development, and I carry that with appreciation rather than nostalgia—and with genuine warmth when I think back on that time.

I wish you a year filled with health, fulfillment, and moments that feel quietly right.

Warmly,
Paul Sehmbey
