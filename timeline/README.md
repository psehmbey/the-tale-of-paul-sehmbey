# Timeline Index — The Tale of Paul Sehmbey

This directory is the canonical narrative spine of the memoir.

Media files remain in `media/` as primary-source artifacts.
Timeline entries interpret, contextualize, and integrate those artifacts
into a coherent life narrative.

No media is duplicated or rehosted here.
