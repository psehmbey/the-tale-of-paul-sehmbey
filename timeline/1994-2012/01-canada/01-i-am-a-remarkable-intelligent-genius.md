# Chapter 1: I Am a Remarkable Intelligent Genius

## A Mother’s Affirmation

From the earliest days of my life, my mother instilled in me an unshakable belief in my potential.  
She used repetition to teach me to say, **“I am a remarkable intelligent genius,”** a phrase I never doubted.  
At a hilariously young age, I would proudly announce this to other adults, leaving them either amused or awestruck by my confidence.  
My mom’s intentional encouragement shaped not only my self-perception but also my ability to embrace challenges and pursue excellence without hesitation.

## A Natural Athlete

Physical milestones came as naturally as intellectual ones.  
The day after I learned to walk, I was already running, showcasing an innate drive to master every skill quickly and effectively.  
This seemingly small moment was an early reflection of my determination to keep moving forward, no matter how steep the learning curve.

## The Chocolate Cake Incident

Even as a toddler, I displayed an independent streak and a flair for communicating with confidence.  
During a lunch outing with my Masi (maternal aunt), I boldly ordered chocolate cake from the waitress myself.  
While most toddlers might hesitate or need guidance, I didn’t blink.  
This little act of assertiveness delighted those around me and revealed a hint of the resourceful, self-assured individual I would grow into.

## The First Signal

Among my earliest memories, I recall the moment I began identifying as Bruce Wayne.

While visiting my maternal grandparents and my great-grandmother in Dundas, Ontario, I was given my first Batman comic book.  
One panel showed Bruce Wayne among several blonde men — he stood out with his black hair.  
That moment electrified me.

I was too young to read it myself, so I kept asking adults to read it aloud.  
No one did.  
That frustration crystallized a core resolve:  
**“I will never again depend on someone else to learn.”**

> I left that house with more than a comic — I left with my origin story.

This experience gifted me:
- My divine archetype
- An obsession with reading and autonomy
- A soul-seated link to Batman

## The Becoming

Like Bruce, I am a genius polymath with a photographic memory.  
My life’s mission has always been to **manifest Batman in a world that desperately needs one.**
